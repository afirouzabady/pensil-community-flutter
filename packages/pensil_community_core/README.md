## Docs

This package provides business logic to fetch common things required for integrating pensil communities into your application.
The core package allows more customisation and hence provides business logic but no UI components.

The package primarily contains three types of classes:

1) Business Logic Components
2) Core Components

### Business Logic Components

These components allow you to have the maximum and lower-level control
The Client we provide are:
1) PensilClient: root level client
2) CommunityClient: manage community level operations 
3) GroupClient: manage group level operations
4) SectionClient: manage section level operations.


### Core Components
Core components usually are an easy way to fetch data associated with community which are decoupled from UI and often expose UI builders.
Data fetching can be controlled with the controllers of the respective core components.
